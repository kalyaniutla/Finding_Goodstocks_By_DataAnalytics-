Introduction
Welcome to the Data Analytics Internship Assignment with ERP Launchpad! This project aims to data manipulation and report dash boarding, analysing and interpreting data effectively in the manufacturing industry.  This assignment, process of extracting, transforming, and visualizing data to drive informed decision-making.
Throughout this document, you'll find detailed explanations and screenshots demonstrating the steps taken to complete the assigned tasks. From filtering and sorting data to creating insightful report dashboards.
Objectives:
Data Manipulation Tasks:
Task 1: Create a new sub-sheet containing data from the "Data Set" sheet based on specified criteria using the Query Function.

Task 2: Utilize Vlookup with ArrayFormula to populate Industry and NSE/BSE Code columns dynamically, incorporating IF conditions for efficient data handling.

Task 3: Calculate Bear Mode 1 and Bear Mode 2 based on percentage changes from 52-week High and Low, and determine Stock Status using multiple IF conditions.

Task 4: Identify the highest value of Market Cap and categorize stocks into Large, Medium, and Low Cap based on specified thresholds.

Task 5: Create a new sheet containing data for 'Good Stock' and apply proper formatting and conditional formatting for enhanced visualization.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project has provided a comprehensive exploration of data manipulation and report dashboarding techniques using Google Sheets and Google Data Studio. Throughout the assignment, we successfully completed a series of tasks aimed at extracting, transforming, and visualizing data from the provided dataset.

We began by filtering and sorting data based on specific criteria, such as PE Ratio and Market Cap, to create organized sub-sheets. Through the implementation of advanced formulas like Query Function and Vlookup with ArrayFormula, we efficiently populated additional columns and calculated key metrics such as Bear Mode indicators and Stock Status.
Furthermore, we categorized stocks into different cap sizes based on Market Cap thresholds, enabling us to gain insights into the distribution of companies within the market. Additionally, we created a visually appealing report dashboard in Google Data Studio, showcasing various charts, scorecards, and filters to facilitate data analysis and decision-making.

Overall, this project has not only enhanced our proficiency in data manipulation and visualization but has also provided valuable insights into the dynamics of the manufacturing industry. By leveraging the power of data analytics, we are better equipped to derive actionable insights and drive informed business decisions in the future.
